## Week 3 Complete: From Concepts to Code

This week felt like a major turning point in my learning journey. It was the week where many of the theoretical concepts I've been studying started to connect and come to life in practical, hands-on applications.

### Key Highlights from the Week:

* **Python - Building Real Tools:** I moved beyond basic scripts and learned how to handle files directly with Python. This feels like a gateway to building more complex applications that can interact with real-world data, not just user input.

* **DevOps - The Big Picture:** My understanding of DevOps concepts grew, particularly around the CI/CD pipeline. I'm starting to see how the Git branching skills I'm practicing are the first crucial step in a long, automated chain that delivers value to users.

* **Project: Putting It All Together with Pandas:** The highlight of the week was applying my skills to my aviation data project. I used the powerful Pandas library to filter a massive dataset and answer a specific question: "How many accidents involved Airbus aircraft?" This wasn't just a textbook exercise; it was solving a real problem with code.

* **A Critical Debugging Lesson:** I also encountered and solved a classic Python bug involving a filename conflict. It was a powerful, hands-on lesson in how programming environments work and the importance of careful naming conventionsâ€”a mistake I won't make again!

It's an incredible feeling to see different threads of learning start to weave together into a cohesive skill set. I'm excited to build on this momentum in Week 4.
