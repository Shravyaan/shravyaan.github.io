# Welcome to My Learning Journey!

This is my new blog, built with GitHub Pages.

Here, I'll be documenting my progress as I learn new technologies. My goal for this project is to:

* Create a professional portfolio.
* Get comfortable with Git and GitHub.
* Share what I learn with others.

Stay tuned for new posts!
