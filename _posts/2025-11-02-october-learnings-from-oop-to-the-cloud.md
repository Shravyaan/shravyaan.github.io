## October in Review: From OOP to the Cloud

October was a month of incredible growth. I dove deep into my learning plan and connected the dots between many different areas of technology. The two biggest themes for me were Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and the foundational concepts of DevOps and Cloud.

### My Favorite Topic: Practical OOP

My favorite part of the month was building practical projects with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). I started by creating a simple `Aircraft` class with `take_off()` and `land()` methods. Then, I expanded on it using **inheritance** to create a `CommercialAircraft` class that inherited those methods and added its own new attributes.

The real "aha!" moment came when I combined OOP with API skills in the **Flight Tracker project**. I built a `Flight` class where the constructor (`__init__`) *itself* calls a live flight data API, parses the JSON response, and stores the flight's status, origin, and destination as attributes. Seeing an object "come to life" with real-world data was a huge breakthrough.

### Building Real Tools and Skills

Beyond OOP, I tackled several other key areas:

* **APIs & Web Services:** I built a complete mini-project, the "Airport Info Fetcher," which uses an authenticated API to retrieve data. I also wrote a blog post explaining the difference between web scraping and using JSON APIs, which really solidified my understanding.

* **Core Data Structures:** I moved from just *using* data structures to understanding *how they work*. I studied the theory of Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues. This knowledge was immediately useful for solving classic LeETCode problems like "Reverse Linked List."

* **The "Cloud" & DevOps Foundation:** This month, I got a high-level introduction to the most important concepts in modern infrastructure:
    * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The idea of managing servers with code, not clicks.
    * **Docker:** Understanding how containers package an app and its dependencies to run anywhere.
    * **AWS Compute:** Reviewing the difference between **EC2** (virtual servers) and **Lambda** (serverless functions).

### A New Portfolio

Finally, the most rewarding part of this month was taking all this work and presenting it professionally. I created a brand-new **GitHub Profile README**, which acts as a landing page for my portfolio. It was the perfect way to wrap up a month of hard work.
