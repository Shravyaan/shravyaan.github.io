title:  'My Upskilling Journey: Setting Up for Success'
---

## And So It Begins...

Welcome to my new technical blog! This is the first official post of what I plan to be a detailed documentation of my upskilling journey into the world of technology. The purpose of this blog is to track my progress, solidify my learning by writing about it, and create a portfolio of my work.

### The "Why": My Motivation and Goals

I've started this journey because I am passionate about building a career in tech and learning new skills. My primary goals over the next few months are to:
* Gain a solid foundation in software development and aerospace technology.
* Build several small projects to apply what I learn.
* Become proficient with professional tools and workflows.

### The "How": My Toolkit for Success

To make sure I stay on track, I've set up a few key tools. The most important one is this blog itself! It's built using **GitHub Pages** and **Jekyll**, which I learned how to set up over the last couple of days. The process taught me a lot about Git, repositories, and how static sites are generated. It's the perfect platform to write about my technical progress.

### What's Next?

My first area of focus is building context in the **aerospace industry**. I've just spent some time reading about the incredible work being done at Airbus, especially in areas like sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), the ZEROe hydrogen aircraft concept and the air traffic management. It really is very interesting to see soo many developments in the aerospace technology.
I'm excited to dive deeper into this field.

This journey is a marathon, not a sprint, and I'm ready for the challenge. Stay tuned for the next update!
