## Diving Deeper: Databases, AWS, and C++

Refuting the "Jack of all trades, master of none" myth.

This past month has been a deep dive into the technical layers that power our modern world. From the precision required in C++ pointers to the global scale of AWS Cloud architecture, my upskilling journey has reached a new level of complexity.

# 🏗️ The Bridge: Connecting Logic and Data

The highlight of this month was building a Python-SQL Connector. It's one thing to write code, and another to make that code "remember" things.

By designing a normalized schema (3NF) for a flight tracking system and bridging it with a Python backend, I solved the "Ghost File" problem. I learned how to use executescript to automate database deployment, ensuring that the application and its data source are always in sync.

# ☁️ Scaling Up: The AWS Cloud Journey

Completing the AWS Cloud Practitioner modules has changed how I view infrastructure. Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model and AWS Pricing has taught me that good engineering isn't just about building things that work—it's about building things that are cost-effective and secure.

Mastering the different Support Plans (from Basic to Enterprise) and cost management tools like AWS Budgets has given me the "Business of Tech" perspective needed to lead projects.

# 🚀 Legacy Awareness: Fortran in Aerospace

Aerospace isn't all shiny new JavaScript frameworks. This month, I gained awareness of Fortran. Understanding how legacy systems handle numerical crunching and why implicit none is a safety requirement has given me a unique edge in understanding the "black box" systems that still guide satellites and aircraft today.

# 🎨 The User's View: HTML Foundations

Finally, I touched the surface of the web. Building a structured HTML5 application reminded me that no matter how complex the backend is, the user's experience starts with a well-structured document. Semantic HTML is the skeleton that keeps the internet accessible and organized.

# 📈 Key Stats for the Month:

Languages Touched: Python, SQL, C++, Fortran, HTML.

Architecture: Designed a 3-table normalized relational schema.

Cloud: Completed Module 9 of the AWS CCP path.

Debugging: Conquered pathing errors and syntax traps in a multi-language environment.

# 🔭 Looking Ahead

Next month, the focus shifts toward Data Visualization and Automation. I plan to take these raw flight databases and turn them into visual dashboards, while exploring GitHub Actions to automate my testing workflows.

The journey from a "coder" to a "system architect" continues!
