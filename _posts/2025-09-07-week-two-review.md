## Week 2 Complete: A Huge Leap Forward!

This week was all about catching up and diving deep into the core skills of my learning plan. After a short break, I was determined to get back on track, and I'm proud to say I've completed all the planned tasks. It was a challenging but incredibly rewarding week.

### Key Accomplishments:

* **DevOps Culture & CI/CD:** I learned about the "Why" behind DevOpsâ€”the culture of shared responsibility that breaks down the "wall of confusion" between teams. I also got a high-level overview of the CI/CD pipeline, the automated workflow that takes code to deployment.

* **Python Loops:** I leveled up my Python skills by mastering `for` and `while` loops. I wrote scripts to automate repetitive tasks, like finding the largest and smallest numbers in a series.

* **Professional Git Workflow:** I went beyond `commit` and `push` and learned about **Git branching**. I practiced creating a `dev` branch, working in isolation, and then **merging** that work back into the `main` branch. This was a real "aha!" moment for understanding how professional teams work.

* **My First LeetCode:** I tackled my first algorithmic problem, "Two Sum." It was a great challenge that forced me to break down the logic step-by-step, and I successfully debugged my way to an "Accepted" solution.

* **My First Data Project:** To cap off the week, I used the **pandas** library for the first time to read and analyze a real-world aviation dataset. Installing and using a professional third-party library felt like a huge step forward.

This week was a testament to the power of catching up and staying focused. I'm heading into Week 3 with a clean slate and a lot of new knowledge.
