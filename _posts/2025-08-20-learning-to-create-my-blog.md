title:  'Day 3: I Learned How to Create My First Blog!'
---

## My First Official Post
Today was Day 3 of my upskilling journey, and the main goal was to set up a technical blog using GitHup Pages. It was learning with a few enjoyable twists, but I am very excited to say it's finally live!

### What I learned 

* What GitHub pages is: ** It is a free feature from GitHub that can take a repository and turn it into a live website. It is a very nice feature where you can actually see what you actually put in your blog in a live platform.
* Understanding Jekyll: ** I learned that a tool called Jekyll works behind the scenes. It's like a "Fancier object" that takes a simple text files and builds them into a complete blog with a consistent and fancy theme.
* How to activate it: ** The key to activaing it is to create a special file called `_config.yml` and telling it which theme to use. This file is the main instruction manual for Jekyll.
* How to write posts: ** All my future blog posts need to be stored in a special `_posts` folder, and the files must be named with a proper format.

So this was my experience with GitHub blogs and it was exciting to see a simple text file become a real blog article!
