## Week 4 Complete: Bringing Data to Life

This week felt like a major level-up in my Python journey. I moved beyond the basics and dove deep into the tools that programmers use every single day to manage and understand data. The highlight of the week was seeing it all come together in my first-ever data visualization.

### Key Highlights from the Week:

* **Mastering Python's Workhorses:** I spent a lot of time this week on Python's core data structures: **Lists** and **Dictionaries**. Moving from single variables to these powerful collections feels like learning to think in a new way. I practiced everything from `.append()` to `.sort()` and got comfortable with the logic of key-value pairs.

* **Applying Skills with LeetCode:** To put my new knowledge to the test, I solved the "Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock" problem. It was a fantastic exercise in list manipulation and thinking about efficiencyâ€”a perfect, practical application of the theory.

* **Professional Git Practice:** I practiced **merging branches** and intentionally created and resolved my first **merge conflict**. It was a bit intimidating at first, but successfully navigating it made me feel much more confident about working in a team environment.

* **The Capstone: My First Chart!** The most exciting part of the week was completing the final part of my aviation data project. I installed and used the **Matplotlib** library to create a bar chart of accidents per year. Turning a table of raw data into a visual chart was an incredible "aha!" moment and a very rewarding way to end the project.

This week, the connection between core programming concepts and real-world results became crystal clear. I'm not just learning to code; I'm learning to solve problems and create insights.
