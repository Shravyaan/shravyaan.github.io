## My first week of Upskilling: Complete!!

This week marked the beginning of my journey, and I am thrilled with the progress. The goal was to set up my tools and build a foundation in both my Core Tech (Python) and my Specializtion (Aerospace).

## Key Accomplishments:
* Set up a live blog using GitHub Pages and Jekyll.
* Learned the fundamentals of **Git**, including the `add`, `commit`, and `push` workflow.
* Studied the **Four Forces Of Flight** (Lift, Weight, Thrust, and Drag).
* Wrote my first Python programs, learning about **variables, conditionals, and file handling**.
* Although I felt the new topics in Aerospace amazing it also felt a lot overwhelming and for now I don't actually remember much but I did get the basic idea.
* Totally Aerospace is a wonderful specialization and I totally find it mind blowing

### My First Project:
To cap off the week, I wrote a Python script to read data from a real aviation accident dataset. It succefully opens the CSV file and reads the first 10 rows. It was a great challenge, and I even solved my first `FileNotFoundError`!

I am looking forward to building on this foundation in Week 2.
